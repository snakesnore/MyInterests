		<h1>My Interests</h1>
		<p>One could say that I have many different interests from all kinds of fields. I enjoy art, science and even some sports. This web page was created to document my interests. If you want to know why I started learning how to program, then <a href='AboutMe.html'>click here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Art</h2>
		<p>My art-loving journey began when I was rather young. At three years old my parents bought me my first sketchbook and while I didn't fill it up with masterpieces, it gave me a good base for learning and made me realise that art was something I was interested in.</p>

				<td>At first I used pencils and crayons for drawing. This method has stuck with me since and whenever I don't have paints at hand, I use lead pencils or nowadays even pens to casually sketch on the go.</td>
				<td>My first paints were basic gouache paints found in every kindergarten but because of my negative experiences with them I thought that I didn't like paints. Not until a few years later when I discovered watercolors did I realise how fun paints could actually be. Nowadays I use gouache, watercolor and occasionally even acrylics and oils.</td>

		<h2>Books</h2>
		<p>Books hold a great deal of importance to me. I started reading when I was five, so not that early, but when I was six, I already read rather advanced books, like <em>Tarzan</em>. My kindergarten teacher was rather impressed but the truth was that I couldn't really comprehend the difficult text even if I read without mistakes and in my head.</p>

				<td>My first book was a book of Disney fairytales. It still holds a special place in my heart. Right after kindergarten I got into the Harry Potter books, <em>Chamber of The Secret</em> being my favourite.</td>
				<td>Throughout my teenage years I read tons of books about love, mystery and the paranormal. Most of the stories were really dramatic and tragic so that was probably where I got my more theatrical side. I remember my favorites being the <em>Twilight Saga</em> and most books about vampires.</td>
				<td>When I first discovered Stephen King and horror literature, I thought that I should suddenly stop reading books meant for teenagers. To me it seemed like it was the beginning of a new era and that I should at least try and be an adult. This was a mistake though and it burned me so out that I stopped reading for a year altogether. When I finally got back into it, I ironically started with a teenage fantasy novel named <em>Throne of Glass</em>. This got me back into reading and reminded me that reading is for my own enjoyment and not for impressings others.</td>
